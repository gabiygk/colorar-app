# Colorar Mobile App

Aligning with UN SDG 5, Colorar is a mobile application dedicated to combating violence against women. It offers full support at every stage of the reporting process: providing educational content and a gallery of evidence beforehand, reporting mechanism and legal and emotional assistance during the process, and after reporting, women can share their experiences as well as sell products and services, seeking financial independence.

This is the final prototype of the Colorar mobile app. This prototype includes:

1. **Colorar Aid**: Central hub for assistance from Colorar. Users can report violence, access professional help, and utilize the "flower system" to alert trusted contacts discreetly. ColorarAI offers quick answers, connects users with psychologists, attorneys, and social workers.

2. **Gallery Proof**: Secure storage for private audio evidence. Colorar doesn't access this content, ensuring user privacy. 

3. **ColorarAI**: AI feature answering questions about women's reproductive rights, including access to sexual and reproductive health services.

Collaborations with women's well-being companies offer affordable products, including sustainable sanitary items for those with limited resources.
